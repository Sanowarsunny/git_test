    <p>
        These fruit kabobs make a delicious summer dessert, especially when you are grilling outside already. 
        You can have these cooking while you are enjoying your burgers or steaks! Excellent over vanilla ice cream.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>½ cup butter or margarine </li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>3 fresh peaches, pitted and quartered</li>
        <li>3 fresh plums, pitted and quartered</li>
        <li>3 bananas, cut into 4 pieces each</li>
        <li>12 strawberries, hulled</li>
        <li>12 skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and place a large sheet of foil onto the grate. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter and honey together in a small saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Do not let the sauce boil. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Thread a peach quarter, a plum quarter, a banana piece, and a strawberry onto each skewer. Place the skewers onto the foil on the preheated grill; spoon honey mixture over each skewer. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill until the fruit is softened and the sauce has thickened and cooked onto the fruit, about 5 minutes. Flip the skewers, spoon more margarine-honey sauce over each, and grill for about 5 more minutes on the other side.
        </li>
