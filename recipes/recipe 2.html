    <p>
        In an effort to avoid S'more burnout on our last trip, 
        I came up with this quick recipe you can make right at camp and just toss on the hot coals of the campfire.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 sheets heavy duty aluminum foil (10x12-inch)</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package prepared sponge cake shells</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained, juice reserved</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar, divided</li>
        <li>â…“ cup chopped pecans, divided</li>
        <li>18 maraschino cherries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        
        <li>
            Spray the aluminum sheets with cooking spray, and place a sponge cake shell in the center of each sheet. Spoon the crushed pineapple into the cakes, dividing it equally, and sprinkle each cake with about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar and about 2 teaspoons of nuts. 
            Top each cake with 3 maraschino cherries, and drizzle 1 to 2 teaspoons of the pineapple juice over each cake.     
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap the cakes in the foil, leaving some room at the top for air circulation. 
            Place the foil packs onto the embers of a campfire until the cakes are hot and bubbling, about 10 minutes. 
        </li>
    </ol>
